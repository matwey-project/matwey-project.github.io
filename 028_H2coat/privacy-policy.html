				<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
				<h4>PRIVACY POLICY
					LAST UPDATED: MAY 24, 2018
				</h4>
				<p>Privacy is of utmost importance at the Blockchain group of companies (“Blockchain”). We recognize the significance of protecting information which is stored on our computers or is intended to be stored on our computers and which relates to an individual. The data we protect are the “Personal Data” which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person, sometimes called a data subject, and have made protecting privacy and the confidentiality of Personal Data a fundamental component of the way we do business. This Privacy Policy informs you of the ways we work to ensure privacy and the confidentiality of Personal Data. This policy describes the information we gather, how we use those Personal Data and the circumstances under which we disclose such information to third parties.
				</p>
				<p>In this Policy “Services” means the Blockchain website, any feature provided by us via the website or any local application (mobile desktop or otherwise), including without limitation wallet services or blockchain information services, but excluding API services, which are governed by a separate agreement.
				</p>
				<p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy in general or any part of it, you should not use the Services.
				</p>
				<p>Information you may provide to us: You may give us information about you by filling in forms on our website or through our app or by corresponding with us by phone, email or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you register to use the Services and when you report a problem with the website or with our app. The information you give us may include your name, email address, virtual currency addresses, business card or other identifying document, mobile phone number, alias, password, mobile PIN code, and any other information you choose to provide.
				</p>
				<p>Information we collect about you: With regard to each of your visits to our website or our app we automatically collect the following information:
				</p>
				<p>Log Information: We log technical information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser and version you use, last access time of your wallet, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to create the wallet and the most recent IP address used to access the wallet.
					Device Information: We collect information about the mobile device you use to access our mobile application, including the hardware model, operating system and version, unique device identifiers and mobile network information, but this information is anonymized and not tied to any particular person.
					Address Information: When you create a wallet through our Services, you may choose to generate a public and private key pair. When you log out of the wallet, we collect an encrypted file, that, if unencrypted, would contain these keys, along with your transaction history. When you enable notifications through your Account Settings, we will collect the unencrypted public key in order to provide such notifications. Under no circumstances do we ever collect an unencrypted private key from you, nor can we decrypt any wallet file data.
					Information We Collect from Other Sources: We also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For instance:
				</p>
				<p>When you log in to our support desk center via a third-party social media service, we collect information about your social media account in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media service, including your public profile, friend list and email address.
					We use third-party services (e.g. Zendesk) co-branded as Blockchain but will do so with clear notices. Any third-party services may collect information as determined by their own privacy policies.
					We also use "cookies" from time to time to help personalize your online experience with us. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer to help us make your visit to our site more “user-friendly.” Please see our Cookies Policy for more details about the cookies we use. Cookies provide us with information about your use of the site that can help us improve the site and your experience with it. We will process Personal Data collected through cookies in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you should receive a warning message with each cookie. You may refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser, however, you should be aware that our site, like most other popular sites, may not work well with cookies disabled.
				</p>
				<h4>2. USE OF PERSONAL DATA
				</h4>
				<p>As it is in our legitimate interests to be responsive to you and to ensure the proper functioning of our products and organisation, we will use your information to:
				</p>
				<p>Understand and meet your needs and preferences in using our Services;
					Develop new and enhance existing service and product offerings;
					Manage and develop our business and operations;
					Carry out any purposes for which we have received your consent; and
					Meet legal and regulatory requirements.
					We also reserve the right to use aggregated Personal Data to understand how our users use our Services, provided that those data cannot identify any individual.
					We use Google Analytics which is a web analytics tool that helps us understand how users engage with the website. Like many services, Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track user interactions as in our case, where they are used to collect information about how users use our website. This information is used to compile reports and to help us improve our website. The reports disclose website trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics without affecting how you visit our site – for more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all website you use, visit this Google page: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
				</p>
				<p>We will process your Personal Data legally and fairly and not use it outside the purposes of which we have informed you. So far as we are able we shall ensure that all of your Personal Data is accurate and up to date
