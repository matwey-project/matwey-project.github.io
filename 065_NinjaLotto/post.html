            <p>We all want to win the lottery, right? </p>
            <p>But how do we <strong>improve our odds of winning</strong> a life-changing lottery jackpot? </p>
            <p>You may have heard of lottery syndicates or ‘group play’ play, as it’s sometimes referred.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you’ve played in a work syndicate, where someone collects money and buys tickets on your behalf. </p>
            <p>In this post we explain the principals of a lottery syndicate and the <strong>benefits and downsides</strong> of sharing lottery entries.  </p>
            <p>The breakdown of what we’ll cover:</p>

            </ul>
            <p></p>
            <h2 class="text-center">What are Lottery Syndicates?</h2>
            <p>The more times you enter a lottery draw, the more chances you have of winning - but at a larger cost.</p>
            <p>In a syndicate you <strong>share multiple lottery lines with a group of players</strong>, with any prizes won split between all syndicate members.</p>

            <p>So, for lotteries, ‘syndicate’ is just a fancy name for people who pool their tickets.</p>
            <blockquote class="quote-border">I can remember saying ‘if we don’t make it home just make sure you spend it all’. It was the longest flight of our life!</blockquote>
            <p>But, of course, you would also <strong>share that jackpot</strong>. </p>
            <p>Not that we would mind sharing a huge lottery win, as when it comes to huge lottery jackpots that share can make you a millionaire.</p><img src="img/post-image/post.jpg" alt="">
            <div class="height-30"></div>
            <h2 class="text-center">Work Lottery Syndicates</h2>
            <p>Two-thirds of UK syndicates are work based according to UK National Lottery organiser Camelot.</p>
            <p>However, they also estimate that only half have written agreements.</p>
            <blockquote class="quote-border">A formal and legally binding agreement sounds tiresome but could avoid disputes further down the line.</blockquote>
            <p>Important things to include in a syndicate agreement: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Date is was drawn up</li>
              <li>Syndicate managers name</li>
              <li>Each members’ name</li>
              <li>Which draws will be entered and how many lines</li>
              <li>How much each member will pay and how</li>
              <li>What happens if someone misses a payment</li>
              <li>Procedure when someone leaves the syndicate</li>
              <li>Each members’ share of any prize</li>
              <li>How and when prizes are paid</li>
              <li>Whether the syndicate would want publicity</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It should be signed and dated by each member and if the syndicate changes, a new agreement should be drawn up. </p>
            <p>That’s right, <strong>it can be a painful process</strong>, especially with large syndicates. </p>
            <p>Don’t forget, prizes are paid to the syndicate manager / ticket purchaser and not group members individually.</p>
            <p>The manager should then share the prizes, so syndicates must place a <strong>great deal of trust in that person.</strong></p>
            <h2 class="text-center">Do Lottery Syndicates Win?</h2>
            <p>Playing via a syndicate is an <strong>increasingly popular way to play the lottery</strong> around the world.</p>
            <p>However, not all lottery operators provide information on whether an individual or syndicate has won a big jackpot, unless the winner or winners decide to go public.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless Camelot have previously revealed that <strong>‘one in four’ UK Lotto jackpots are won by syndicates.</strong></p><img src="img/post-image/post-001.jpg" alt="">
            <p>There are certainly numerous stories of lottery syndicates that have won jackpots. Here are some of the biggest and best: </p>
            <h3 class="text-center">Syndicate Winners</h3>
            <p>In 2016, a <strong>five-strong family syndicate</strong> from Monmouth in Wales claimed a jackpot of £61million on a EuroMillions rollover. </p>
            <p>That’s just over <strong>£12million apiece.</strong>  </p>
            <p>Sonia Davies had just undergone successful surgery in America to remove a tumour and, along with partner Keith, felt lucky. </p>
            <p>She called daughter Stephanie and her boyfriend Steve, pleading with them to pop out and buy family EuroMillions tickets. </p>
            <p>It proved to be the best decision they’d ever made as, along with Stephanie’s sister Courtney, the five became the <strong>UK’s biggest known syndicate winners.</strong></p><img src="img/post-image/post-002.jpg" alt="">
            <blockquote class="quote-bracket">I can remember saying ‘if we don’t make it home just make sure you spend it all’. It was the longest flight of our life!</blockquote>
            <p>The previous biggest UK syndicate win came back in 2010, when a <strong>group of seven co-workers at Hewlett-Packard</strong> in Liverpool scooped a <strong>£45m EuroMillions jackpot.</strong> </p>
            <p>Two years later, <strong>twelve bus drivers from Northamptonshire</strong> made the headlines when they won a <strong>£38m EuroMillions</strong> pay-out.</p>
            <p>The lucky dozen <strong>each received a £3.1m share</strong> of the haul and quit their jobs immediately.</p>
            <p>More recently, a syndicate of <strong>six catering staff from Neath Port Talbot hospital</strong> hit the jackpot.</p>
            <p>The ‘Catering Girls’ shared a <strong>EuroMillions jackpot of £25.4million</strong> in November 2017.</p>
            <p>That’s just over <strong>£4.2 million each.</strong></p><img src="img/post-image/post-003.jpg" alt="">
            <h2 class="text-center">USA Syndicates</h2>
            <p>Some of the jackpots claimed by syndicates in the United States have been even more impressive.</p>
            <p>Little is known about the <strong>biggest syndicate winners of all time</strong> in the US, although one thing for sure is that they scooped a <strong>$487million Powerball jackpot</strong> on July 15th, 2016.</p>
            <p>The <strong>group from New Hampshire</strong> have steadfastly maintained their anonymity!</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, it was a New Year’s Day to remember for <strong>23 Long Island colleagues</strong> when they each took home a share of a <strong>$437million Mega Millions jackpot</strong> on January 1st, 2019.</p>
            <p>The Long Island prize was only marginally bigger than the <strong>$420.9million Powerball jackpot</strong> won by a syndicate of <strong>20 co-workers from Tennessee</strong> in 2016.</p>
            <p>The group opted to take an immediate cash pay-out worth $254million - or a shade over <strong>$12.7million each.</strong></p>
            <p>In 2012 there were three winning tickets for a <strong>$656million Mega Millions jackpot.</strong></p>
            <p>One of the winning tickets belonged to a group of <strong>three colleagues from Maryland’s public education system.</strong></p>
            <p>They became known to the media as the <strong>‘Three Amigos’.</strong></p>
            <p>Each member of the syndicate put in $20 and together they bought 60 tickets, with <strong>each taking away $72.6million.</strong></p>
            <p>The group had bought 20 ticket each - the first time that they had pooled their money together!</p>
            <p>They also decided to remain anonymous.</p><img src="img/post-image/post-004.jpg" alt="">
            <p>A year later, <strong>16 colleagues from New Jersey’s Ocean County Department of Vehicle Services</strong> held one of three winning tickets for a <strong>$448m Powerball jackpot.</strong></p>
            <p>Each member of the <strong>‘Oceans 16’</strong> syndicate collected a lump sum of <strong>$3.8million.</strong></p><img src="img/post-image/post-005.jpg" alt="">
            <h2 class="text-center">Lottery Syndicates Gone Wrong</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, not all syndicate wins have a happy ending.</p>
            <blockquote class="quote-border">There have been numerous examples from around the world of when things have gone badly wrong. </blockquote>
            <p><strong>You’ll be shocked</strong> at some of these lottery syndicate horror stories:</p>
            <h3>Missed Payments</h3>
            <p>Take, for instance, the tale of <strong>Louisa Whitby</strong>, member of a longstanding <strong>syndicate at a small recruitment company in Liverpool.</strong></p>
            <p>Mum-to-be Louisa was absent from work due to a bout of morning sickness on the day syndicate payments were collected. </p>
            <p>Consequently, <strong>she missed out on a £2.5m share</strong> of a £28.8m EuroMillions pay-out! </p>
            <p>When her colleagues refused to cut her in, Miss Whitby launched what proved to be an unsuccessful attempt to sue them to secure her share.</p>
            <p>Each of them pocketed £2.8 million instead of the £2.5 million they would have earned had she been included.</p>
            <p>A similar situation befell Florida country club employee <strong>Jeanette French</strong>, who failed in a court bid to force fellow syndicate members to share a $16m jackpot.</p>
            <p>The <strong>72-year-old grandmother missed work on the day the $1 contributions were collected</strong>, having been part of the syndicate for eight years.</p>
            <p>Worst of all, she was the person who checked the syndicate tickets and informed other members about the windfall.</p>
            <p>She handed back the winning ticket without realising she would be excluded from the group. </p>
            <p>Each syndicate member received <strong>$1.3 million instead of the $1.1 million</strong> they would have done if she had been included.</p>
            <p>Failure to pay weekly contributions must be the most common cause of disputes among syndicates and highlights the possible pitfalls of joining a work scheme. </p>
            <p>But there have been occasions when one member of the group has simply swindled the others out of their winnings.</p>
            <h2 class="text-center">Fraud</h2>
            <p>One famous example of a <strong>lottery player accused of cheating fellow syndicate members</strong> is the case of Australian <strong>Gary Baron. </strong></p>
            <p>He collected an <strong>Australian Powerball jackpot of $16.6 million</strong> in October 2014.</p>
            <p>Unsurprisingly, he promptly quit his job and began a spending spree which saw him accumulate property and luxury cars.</p>
            <p>But the <strong>‘Powerball Rat’</strong> had been responsible for collecting funds and buying tickets for a syndicate of work colleagues.</p>
            <p>Incredibly they only discovered his good fortune by chance.</p>
            <p>The lottery company sent him a bottle of champagne to toast his winnings using the very courier company he’d quit.</p>
            <p>And yes, the bottle was delivered by a member of the syndicate! </p>
            <p>When confronted, Baron <strong>claimed to have won the jackpot by himself on a separate ticket.</strong></p>
            <p>However, he eventually agreed an undisclosed legal settlement when the rest of the group began legal proceedings against him.</p>
            <blockquote class="quote-bracket">Winning Lotto is like… everybody dreams of it, and it only happened to the lucky few once in a while. This was our shot, and it’s gone. He took it away from us.</blockquote>
            <p>Baron's actions were reminiscent of those of <strong>Americo Lopes</strong>, a highway maintenance worker in New Jersey.</p>
            <p>In 2009 Lopes collected a Mega Millions jackpot of $24 million and quit his job claiming he needed foot surgery.</p>
            <p>But Lopes had been responsible for a <strong>syndicate with five Portuguese colleagues,</strong> from whom he kept the windfall a secret.</p>
            <p>Months later he told one of them that he had won the lottery a week after resigning.</p>
            <p>That proved a big mistake, as suspicions were aroused, and the others soon discovered the true date.</p>
            <p>Like Baron would later do, <strong>he insisted he’d bought the winning ticket for himself</strong>, independent from the syndicate tickets.</p>
            <p>Inevitably, the case went to court where a jury unanimously found Lopes guilty of defrauding his former workmates (below).</p>
            <p>He was <strong>ordered to pay each of them $4 million</strong> of the original $24 million.</p>
            <p>His actions after the win was crucial in their deliberations.</p>
            <p>Not only had he never received the surgery he’d said he needed, he also claimed unemployment benefits after collecting his win.</p>
            <p>But Lopes was not happy, with the New Jersey Star-Ledger newspaper quoting him as saying “They robbed me.”</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Are Syndicates worth it?</h3>
            <p>The above are cautionary tales involving informal syndicates, which are often based solely upon trust.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, office lottery syndicates offer no money-savings, with every member typically paying the normal price of a line (or lines) to enter each draw.</p>
            <p>However, there are <strong>additional benefits in playing with an online lottery syndicate service</strong> like Ninja Lotto:</p><strong>1) Value </strong>
            <p>The price of each entry into a single draw is pooled between syndicate players, significantly reducing your cost per line</p><strong>2) Variety </strong>
            <p>More lotteries can be entered – not just Lotto and EuroMillions, but the biggest lotteries worldwide </p><strong>3) Simplicity </strong>
            <p>The hard work is done for you: finding syndicate members, buying the tickets and checking the results  </p><strong>4) Security </strong>
            <p>Prizes are paid directly into each individual winning syndicate members’ accounts</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>With all lottery syndicates you <strong>increase your chances of hitting the jackpot</strong> with more draw entries shared.</p>
            <p>But you’ll need to share prize winnings with your fellow syndicate members.</p>
            <p>Entering syndicates with colleagues, friends or family can be fun, but also carries a degree of risk without sufficient precautions.</p>
            <p>Long-time players could miss out on substantial sums of money due to late or missed payments.</p>
            <p>Or even a dishonest syndicate manager!</p>
            <blockquote class="quote-border">Playing in online pools with syndicate providers such as Ninja Lotto offers security and reduces the cost of playing.</blockquote>
            <p>What do you think of lottery syndicates?  </p>
