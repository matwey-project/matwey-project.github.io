Services aux Loteries en Europe and Powerball is the trademark of The Multi-State Lottery Association (MUSL). </p>
            <p>The Site enables registered Members to join pre-arranged Lottery Syndicates for official and regulated Lottery Draws. We purchase official Lottery Tickets for each draw to enable our Members to share lines in individual draws, with Winnings divided amongst players in winning Syndicates.</p>
            <p>The Services offered by Ninja Lotto do not fall within the definition of gambling requiring an operating license from the UK Gambling Commission. </p>
            <p>Our Service is NOT governed or regulated by the Financial Services Authority and entry into a Lottery Draw via a syndicate does not amount to joining a collective investment scheme.</p>

            <h2>4.	Our Syndicates</h2>
            <p>We pre-purchase batches of official Lottery Tickets for Lottery Draws, including but not limited to, the UK Lotto, EuroMillions and US PowerBall.</p>
            <p>The Site enables Members to join other Members to share lines in individual Lottery Draws and to share any prizes which may be due if their Syndicate contains winning Lottery Lines.</p>
            <p>The Site does not enable you to choose either the other Members of a Syndicate or the lottery numbers used in each Lottery Line. </p>
            <p>You will not own any Lottery Ticket purchased for the Syndicate all Lottery Tickets are owned by the Company and any unfilled Syndicate places (not purchased by Members) shall be owned by the Company.</p>
            <p>The Company will maintain a record of Syndicate entries for each draw and will calculate the Winnings and distribute them accordingly to each Member of that Syndicate.</p>
            <p>The Company takes all reasonable measures to ensure that each individual Syndicate has different Lottery Numbers from other Syndicates, but this cannot be guaranteed, and we accept no responsibility whatsoever for a perceived dilution of winnings in this event.</p>
            <p>As the Syndicate organiser, the Company incorporates a fee for managing the Syndicate in the Entry Fee for each Lottery Draw.</p>

            <p>Each Syndicate consists of up to sixty-five (65) Members. Whenever a Syndicate wins a prize, the monies are divided by 65 and distributed equally according to each Members’ share of that Syndicate. For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution is not necessarily based upon the number of people in each winning Syndicate, but instead upon the number of shares (65).</p>
            <p>Each Syndicate entry is independent of any other and Members are allocated a unique Syndicate ID Number for each individual draw. </p>
            <p>The winning numbers for each Lottery Draw will be displayed in Members’ accounts on the Site shortly after the completion of each draw. Details of how Winnings are paid are set out in clause 7.</p>

            <p>The Company reserves the right to require a Member to supply further documentation to verify their age or identity, or to request an authentication agency to verify the member’s identity. </p>
            <p>If the Company discovers a member was not eligible to register an account or enter a Syndicate in accordance with the Terms of Use, the company may withhold any winnings due to that Member. </p>
            <p>Once winnings are distributed to a Members’ Ninja Lotto account, they may request withdrawal.</p>

            <p>To comply with anti-money laundering legislation, if you have deposited into your Account using one Debit Card, you will have to withdraw back onto that same Debit Card. If you have used more than one Debit Card, you will need to balance any net deposits on both cards, before you can withdraw more than you have deposited on either method.</p>
            <p>In certain countries (including the USA), lottery prizes are subject to variations in the way in which the payment is made, including the giving the winner or winners of Jackpot prizes payment options. In such instances you hereby give the Company outright authority to choose, at our sole discretion, the payment method to accept. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company will always select an immediate lumpsum payment rather than annuity payments distributed over years. This is usually substantially less than the advertised jackpot prize and the Company will under no circumstances be held responsible for any perceived loss of prize money by any Member of the winning Syndicate. </p>

            <p>In the event that the Company, having exhausted all reasonable efforts, is unable to obtain said winnings, for whatever reason or cause, the Company does not accept any liability whatsoever from any and all claims, losses, liabilities, demands, damages, costs, or expenses, as far as is permitted in law. </p>
            <p>The Company shall not be liable for any lost lottery ticket, or failure to lodge a form or purchase a lottery ticket, whether such failure or error arises from our, or one of our service provider’s systems or from our, or one of our service provider’s human error.</p>
            <p>You acknowledge that content regarding a Lottery Draw, including the official results of all Lottery Draws, are based on information that we obtain from Lottery Operators or other third-parties and such content may be incorrect, incomplete, or subject to change.

            <p>In the event of a failure or malfunction of the Site or processes, which impacts upon a Member and which has a material adverse effect on any Member’s ability to participate in a Syndicate, the Company shall, at its discretion, either refund the affected Member the sums paid by that Member in joining a Syndicate for the Lottery Draw in question, or offer the affected Member a place in another Syndicate for the same period for which the Member was unable to participate.</p>
            <p>Information on the Site may by incomplete, out of date or inaccurate or contain technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. Information may be amended or updated without notice, including changes in the products described in this information at any time without notice.</p>

This disclaimer includes the event of an incorrect acquisition of Syndicate numbers or line entries resulting in a loss of Prize money, however caused, including human error.</p>
            <p>Nothing in these Terms of Use limits or excludes any liability which cannot be excluded or limited by applicable law. Should any part of these terms be found by any court or competent authority to be illegal, void or unenforceable, then the Company shall amend or delete the provision. The amendment or deletion of any clause will not affect the remaining clauses and provisions.</p>
            <p>Our total liability to you in respect of any losses arising under or in connection with these Terms of Use, your Account and your use of the Site, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), breach of statutory duty, or otherwise, shall in no circumstances exceed the amount owed to you in the amount you have paid for entry of the draw(s) at the time of such breach.</p>

            <h2>17.	Force Majeure</h2>
            <p>The Company shall not be liable for any delay or failure in performance of any part of its obligations to the extent that such delay or failure results from any cause beyond its reasonable control including, without limitation, fire, flood, strikes, lockouts, hardware, software or telecommunications failure or any government action.</p>
            <p>The Company shall be entitled, without any liability on its part, to alter, suspend or terminate any of its services on the Site or otherwise to comply with any legal or regulatory requirements.</p>
